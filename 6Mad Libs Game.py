#Mad Libs game is basically a game whereby you can enter in a bunch of random words and then put them into a story

#Initial Code
#print("Roses are red")
#print("Violets are blue")
#print("I love you")

#Fot the first line of code lets have the user enter their own color
#print("Roses are {color}")
#print("{plural noun} are blue")
#print("I love {celebrity")

#Therefore we establish variables for color, plural noun, and celebrity
color = input("Enter a color: ")
plural_noun = input("Enter a plural noun: ")
celebrity = input("Enter the name of a celebrity: ")
print("Roses are " + color)
print(plural_noun + " are blue")
print("I love " + celebrity)
