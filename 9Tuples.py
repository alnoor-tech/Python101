#Tuple is a type of data structure which is basically a container to store different values
coordinates = (4, 5) #A tuple with coordinates inside of it. A tuple uses parenthesis instead of squarebrackets like in a list
#Unlike a list, tuple is immutable, which means that a tuple can't be changed or mordified.
print(coordinates[0])
print(coordinates[1])
coordinates_1 = [(1, 3), (4, 5), (11, 9.1)] #This is a tuple list
print(coordinates_1[2])
#Tuple is used to store data that cannot be changed or manipulated
