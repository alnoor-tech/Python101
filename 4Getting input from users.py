#All you need to do get an input from a user is to type input and then opening and closing parenthesis
#Inside the parenthesis we can type a prompt, like the thing we want to get from them
#We assign the input into a variable so that we can be able to access it and work with it
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age:")
print("Hi " + name + "! Welcome!")
print("Wow " + name + "! You are " + age + " years old!")
